      <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
      <p>
        I was a bookkeeper junior at London biggest training firm, I received
        Accounting and finance qualification at BPP university. I enjoyed the
        practical skills of Accounting and mastered a number of softwares like
        SAGE50, QuickBooks that made my job a lot easier. I instantly found
        these softwares interesting and curious about how it was made and it
        works. Quickbooks was written in C++, one of the earliest programming
        languages These desktop application made my experience less complicated
        than using Excel spreadsheet to record transactions. After the
        internship, i had developed a passion for software and programming and
        went to study the fundementals of HTML and Css.

            I am excited to join the FoundersAndCoders intensive bootcamp
            because it provides an opportunity of getting into tech regardless
            of one's previous technical experience or qualifications. I think
            this bootcamp offers something unique compared to other bootcamps
            and FoundersAndCoders offers the chance of fulltime apprenticeship,
            as it will enhance the skills and experience of the student once
            they finish the part-time course.

            After completing the fundementals course online,I started to build
            these projects and I have faced few challenges during the building
            and I had to study the errors and find solution throught online as
            well as trying to come up my own solution.
