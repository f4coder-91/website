      <h1>Tell us about you?</h1>
      <p>
        I graducated from university studying Accounting and finance two year
        ago. I was able to complete before we enter our first Covid-19 Lockdown.
        I was excited to land a role in finace and signed up for training
        internship in one of biggest firms in London. I knew I had to get
        practical experience in order to increase the odd of being employed.
        Having completed the programme, I have gained tons of experience and
        skills in relation of Bookkeeping and Tax return. During my time there,
        I was exposed to using a variety of accounitng softwares such as SAGE50
        and QuickBooks and more. At first, I fascinted and curious as how it
        works and how it was designed.These desktop application made my
        experience less complicated than using Excel spreadsheet to record
        transactions.

        <!-- passing to tech -->
        After the internship, i had developed a passion for software and
        programming and went to study the fundementals of HTML and Css.

            I am really excited to join FoundersAndCoders intensive bootcamp
            because it provides an opportunity of getting into tech to everyone
            regardless of one's previous technical experience or qualifications.
            whilst learning the fundementals of HTML and CSS using online
            resources that is provided by FreeCodeCamp, I enjoyed building these
            projects. Wuith my new skills, I started to build these projects
            using the fundementals
            <!-- list  quality skills -->
            I have face few challenges during the projects and i had to study
            the errors and find solution throught online as well as trying to
            come up my own solution. <br />
