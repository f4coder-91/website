    Thing to talk about:
    I graduated from university studying ACCA accounting course before our first lockdown.
    //. I completed the ACCA Accounting degree course at the University just before we enter // // our first lockdown.
    I was excited to get a role in accounting and I got internship from one of the training firms in London. I knew I had to get an experience in order to increase my chance of being employed. So, I spent 6 months there training and I learned a lot in terms of the practical aspects in book keeping and as well as filing Tax return. Whilst at the training centre, I was using variety of accounting software like SAGE and QuickBooks and more. I was fascinated and curious as how it was made and how useful and easy it was to use to do my job. I enjoyed using because it was reducing the tedious and repetition tasks, I had to do daily like recording invoices into the system.

    After the internship, I had developed a passion for software and programming and went on to study HTML and CSS from various online resources. As well as other few courses from Udemy. These skills have led me to complete few project that showcase what I learned from those courses.
